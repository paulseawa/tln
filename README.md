# The Long Nap

This is my La Petite Mort [entry](https://paulseawa.itch.io/the-long-nap) for [Ectocomp 2020](https://itch.io/jam/ectocomp-2020-english). 
 
This game was written in four hours, per the requirements of the contest, however the latest version of 
this source code has a couple bug fixes in it that were reported by players.

The game is my first attempt using [Dialog](https://www.linusakesson.net/dialog/) which is a new
interactive fiction authoring language developed by [Linus Ã…kesson](https://www.linusakesson.net/).

If you have any questions about the implementation, feel free to ping me here on github, or visit
[intfiction.org](https://intfiction.org) and PM me (paulseawa).
